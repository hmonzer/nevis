With Nebula Systems valuation at $40/share and your strike price at $2, the spread is significant ($3.8M). This will trigger a substantial AMT adjustment. I will have my team run the numbers and send over a projection showing the tax impact under both 'exercise and hold' vs 'exercise and sell' scenarios. We need to ensure this aligns with your long-term liquidity needs, as the tax bill will be due next April even if you don't sell the stock.\n\nC: What about a cashless exercise?\nA: It triggers ordinary income tax immediately rather than AMT, but it eliminates the out-of-pocket cash requirement. Given your aggressive growth profile, holding might be better for long-term QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) benefits if the stock was issued when Nebula had gross assets under $50M. Let's schedule a follow-up call with your legal counsel to confirm the QSBS eligibility.\n\nC: What about a cashless exercise?\nA: It triggers ordinary income. Let's circle back to this point in the next quarterly review. Let's schedule a follow-up call with your legal counsel. Can you clarify the timeline for this implementation?

He is requesting an additional $50k for his MBA tuition.\nA: Let's review the trust deed provisions regarding educational distributions. The Discretionary Trust allows for 'Health, Education, Maintenance, and Support' (HEMS). Lucas's request falls squarely within the 'Education' provision. However, we should ensure this aligns with the long-term liquidity needs of the trust, as we have the quarterly distribution to the Foundation coming up next month. I will have my team run the cash flow numbers and send over a projection to ensure we don't need to liquidate any core holdings.\n\nC: Also, Sarah mentioned she wants to access her portion of the principal early for a gallery investment.\nA: That is a valid concern. The trust stipulates principal distributions are only available at age 30. Sarah is currently 27. We cannot authorize an early distribution without a deed variation, which would require legal counsel. Let's schedule a follow-up call with your legal counsel to discuss if a loan against her future interest is a viable alternative.\n\n--- NOTES ---\nAction Item: Send the updated fee schedule to the client.
